              We may process your personal data for one or more lawful bases of processing (“Lawful Basis”) depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data.
              The Lawful basis are the following:

            <h3 class="mt-8 text-xl/8 font-semibold text-gray-900">Management of personal information.</h3>
            <p class="mt-3">
              We are committed to safeguarding and protecting personal data and will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to protect any personal data provided to us from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.
              We have appointed a Data Protection Officer to ensure that our management of personal information is in accordance with this privacy notice and the applicable legislation.
              We require organizations outside the myPort Capital who handle or obtain personal information acknowledge the confidentiality of this information, undertake to respect any individual’s right to privacy and comply with all relevant data protection laws and this privacy notice.
              In brief, the data protection measures we have in place are the following:
            </p>
            <ul role="list" class="mt-5 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6 marker:text-gray-300">
              <li>We train our employees who handle personal information to respect the confidentiality of customer information and the privacy of individuals.</li>
              <li>Requiring our employees to use passwords and two-factor authentication when accessing our systems.</li>
              <li>We apply Chinese walls, and employees only have access to the personal data required for the purposes of the tasks they handle.</li>
              <li>We apply data encrypting technologies during data transmission during internet transactions and client access codes transmitted across networks.</li>
              <li>Employing firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and virus scanning tools to protect against unauthorized persons and viruses entering our systems.</li>
              <li>Using dedicated secure networks or encryption when we transmit electronic data for purposes of outsourcing.</li>
              <li>Practising a clean desk policy in all premises occupied by us and our related bodies corporate and providing secure storage for physical records.</li>
              <li>Employing physical and electronic means such as access cards, cameras, and guards to protect against unauthorized access.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="mt-8 text-xl/8 font-semibold text-gray-900">How do we store personal information and for how long? </h3>
            <p class="mt-3">
              We hold personal information in a combination of secure computer storage facilities and paper-based files and other records and take steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
              When we consider that personal information is no longer needed, we will remove any details that will identify you or we will securely destroy the records.
              However, we may need to maintain records for a significant period of time. For example, we are subject to investment services and anti-money laundering laws which require us to retain copies and evidence of the actions taken by us in regard to your identity verification, sources of incomes and wealth, monitoring of your transactions, telephone, chat and email communications, orders and trades history, handling of your complaints and records that can demonstrate that we have acted in line with regulatory code of conduct throughout the business relationship. These records must be maintained for a period of five years after our business relationship with you has ended or even longer if we are asked by our Regulators.
              Personal data provided by you as a prospective client during account opening registration in case the registration was never completed or your account opening application was rejected, will be maintained for six months unless there is a regulatory reason requiring us to keep it for a longer period of time.
              Where you have opted out of receiving marketing communications, we will hold your details on our suppression list so that we know you do not want to receive these communications.
              The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers or Affiliate companies. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
              When we transfer your data to other third parties outside the EEA, we may in some cases rely on applicable standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules, the EU-US Privacy Shield or any other equivalent applicable arrangements
              If you would like a copy of such arrangements, please contact us using the contact details below
              Your rights
              Please note that these rights do not apply in all circumstances. You are entitled to:
              (a) request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”);
              (b) request correction of the personal data that we hold about you;
              (c) request erasure of your personal data. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request;
              (d) object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms;
              (e) request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:

            </p>
            <ul role="list" class="mt-5 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6 marker:text-gray-300">
              <li>If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy;</li>
              <li>Where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it;</li>
              <li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it, as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims;</li>
            </ul>

            <p>(f) request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information (i.e. not to hard copies) which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you;</p>
            <p>(g) withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.</p>
            <p>Please complete the personal data request by email using the registered email address you disclosed to us, to the following email address:</p>
            <p class="text-primary-700"><a href="mailto:support@myportcapital.com" style="text-decoration: underline;">support@myportcapital.com</a></p>

            <p class="text-primary-700"><a href="mailto:marketing@myportcapital.com" style="text-decoration: underline;">marketing@myportcapital.com</a></p>
            <p>Erasure requests can also be submitted through your online portal.</p>
            <p>We try to respond to all requests within 1 (one) month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than 1 (one) month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you within 1 (one) month of the receipt of your request and keep you updated.</p>
            <p>We may charge you a reasonable fee when a request is manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive, or we receive a request to provide further copies of the same data. In this case, we will send you a fee request which you will have to accept prior to us processing your request. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
