              </h2>
              <p class="mt-8">
                This agreement is a contract between a buyer and seller, allowing traders and investors to profit from price movements without actually owning the underlying asset. The value of the contract is based on the price difference between the time of trade entry and exit. Users must accept any profits or losses from their transactions.
                The contract logs differences in the value of the financial product and presents them to users. Investors never own the underlying asset but instead earn income based on its price change.
                Benefits of this type of trading include access to the underlying asset at a lower cost, ease of execution, and the ability to go long or short. However, there are also risks, such as sudden drops in the starting position and the need to maintain an adequate margin.
                This type of contract is subject to industry regulation and terms and conditions, and users should be aware of the risks involved before entering into any trades.

              <h2 class="mt-8 text-pretty text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-1xl">What is Leverage?
              </h2>
              <p class="mt-8">
                Leverage is a financial concept that involves using borrowed funds to increase the potential profits of an investment. By using leverage, an investor can access a larger amount of capital than what they have available, allowing them to take on larger positions and potentially earn greater returns. However, leverage can also amplify losses, so investors need to manage their risk carefully when using leverage.
                Outside of finance, leverage can be seen in many aspects of daily life. For example, taking out a loan to start a business or using a car loan to purchase a vehicle can be considered form of leverage. In both cases, the borrower is using someone else’s money to finance an investment, with the hope of generating a return that exceeds the cost of the loan.

              </p>
              <h2 class="mt-8 text-pretty text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-1xl">Leveraged Transactions
              </h2>
              <p class="mt-8">
                Leverage is a common strategy used in finance to increase the potential returns on investments. One way to achieve leveraged exposure to the cryptocurrency markets is through the use of leveraged tokens, which are derivatives that allow investors to gain leveraged exposure without actively managing a leveraged position. Unlike other leveraged products such as margin trading and perpetuals, leveraged tokens do not require traders to work with margins, liquidation, collateral, or funding rates. This is because leveraged tokens periodically rebalance themselves to maintain a certain leverage threshold, which means that the actual leverage is constantly changing with price fluctuations. Leveraged tokens can be a useful tool for investors looking to gain exposure to cryptocurrency markets without the need to manage complex leveraged positions. However, as with any investment strategy, it is important to understand the risks involved and to carefully consider the potential returns and losses before making any investment decisions.

              <h2 class="mt-8 text-pretty text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-1xl">Summary
              </h2>
              <p class="mt-8">
                Leverage is a powerful tool that can amplify returns, but it also comes with higher risks. It’s essential to understand the mechanics of different leveraged products and their associated risks before using them. At myPort Capital, users who choose to trade with leverage must accept the risks of potential profit and loss. By using our brokerage services, they agree to the terms and obligations outlined in the contract. It’s critical to do extensive research before making any leveraged trades and to carefully consider your financial situation and risk tolerance. Remember, leverage can magnify gains, but it can also magnify losses, so it’s crucial to approach it with caution and use it wisely.

              <h2 class="mt-8 text-pretty text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-1xl">Lot requirement rules within the gift campaign

              </h2>
              <p class="mt-8">
                Lot requirement rules are often used in gift campaigns to ensure that traders are actively engaged in the trading process. Typically, lot requirements are set as a minimum volume of trades that must be completed within a certain timeframe in order to qualify for a gift or bonus. However, there are some rules that traders should be aware of before participating in such campaigns.
                Firstly, transactions that are under 3 minutes are not valid for lot counting. This is to prevent traders from making quick trades solely for the purpose of meeting the lot requirement, without actually engaging in the market.
                Additionally, hedge transactions are invalid, as they can be used to manipulate the market and the outcome of the gift campaign. Trades that are closed negative, or at a loss, are also invalid in lot counting, as they do not contribute to the overall success of the trading process.
                It’s important to note that while there is a lot requirement, the account is definitely locked and there is no withdrawal. This is to ensure that traders do not withdraw their funds before completing the required number of trades.
                Traders should carefully read and accept the terms and conditions of the lot requirement before participating in the campaign. None of the above items can be changed or offered to be changed, so it’s important to understand the rules before beginning to trade. By following these guidelines, traders can participate in gift campaigns in a fair and transparent manner.
